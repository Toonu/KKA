	@description = The Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser weapons system is a megawatt-class chemical oxygen iodine laser primarily designed as a missile defense system to destroy tactical ballistic missiles while in boost phase. The YAL-1 with a low-power laser was test-fired in flight at an airborne target in 2007. A high-energy laser was used to intercept a test target in January 2010.

	@description = The Boeing AGM-86 ALCM is subsonic air-launched cruise missile developed to increase the effectiveness and survivability of the Boeing B-52H Stratofortress strategic bomber. The missile dilutes an enemy's forces and complicates air defense of its territory. Further development extended its range so much that it emerged as a weapon allowing the B-52s to launch their attacks while still well outside Soviet airspace, saturating their defenses with hundreds of tiny, low-flying targets that were extremely difficult to see on radar.

	@description = The Raytheon AIM-120D Air-to-Air Active radar homing Missile is an upgraded version of the AIM-120 with improvements in almost all areas, including 50% greater range (than the already-extended range AIM-120C-7) and better guidance over its entire flight envelope yielding an improved kill probability. AIM-120B deliveries began in 1994.
