It is a robust piece that focuses on the essential features of a towed field gun suitable for all conditions. The D-30 has a maximum range of 15.4 kilometers, or over 21 km using RAP ammunition. With its striking three-leg mounting, the D-30 can be rapidly traversed through 360 degrees. Although no longer manufactured in the nations of the former Soviet Union, the D-30 is still manufactured internationally and is in service in more than 60 countries' armed forces.

The GSh-30-1 has a rate of fire of 1,800 rounds per minute, despite that, its barrel life is quite short: 2,000 rounds. The GSh-30-1 is equipped with a unique pyrotechnic mechanism to clear misfires: a small pyrotechnic cartridge is located to the left of the 30mm cartridge chamber. This pyrotechnic cartridge fires a small steel bolt through the side wall of the 30mm cartridge. The hot propellant gases following the bolt into the dud 30mm round ignite the powder charge of that round and firing continues. Used on the Su-27, Su-30, Su-33, Su-34, Su-35, Su-37, Su-57, MiG-29, Yak-141, Shenyang J-11, J-15, J-16 and 9A4273 gun pod.
