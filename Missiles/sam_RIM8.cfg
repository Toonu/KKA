	description = The Bendix RIM-8 "Talos" Long-Range Surface-to-Air Semi-Active Radar Homing Missile was among the earliest SAMs to equip United States Navy ships. It was meant to complement the smaller RIM-2 Terrier and RIM-24 Tartar during the era of 3 T-Missiles, similar to current era of Standard Missiles aboard USN ships.
