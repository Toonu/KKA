	description = The Hughes AIM-4 "Falcon" Short-Range Semi-Active Radar Homing Air-to-Air Missile is one of the first missiles designed by Hughes Aircraft. Highly expensive, volatile, and prone to missing, it represents the pinnacle of Hughes Aircraft's ingenuity. With a hit rate of less than 10%, it strikes fear into the heart of any enemies. Warranty void if engine is lit. The missile entered service with the USAF in 1956.
