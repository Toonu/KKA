	description = The Zvezda-Strela Kh-23/Kh-66 "Grom" (AS-7) "Kerry" are a family of early Soviet tactical air-to-surface missiles with a range of 10 km. They were intended for use against small ground or naval targets. The Kh-66 was effectively a heavy-warhead, beam-riding version of the K-8 air-to-air missile rushed into service in Vietnam in 1968. Kh-66 doesn't like to be called Kerry but Terry instead.
