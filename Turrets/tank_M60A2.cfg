	description = During the early 1960s there was some debate regarding the future of main tank weaponry, largely focusing on conventional kinetic energy rounds versus missiles. In the early 1960s it was generally accepted that the maximum effective range of the M68 gun was between 1800 and 2000 meters.  In response, studies were made in August 1961 to retrofit existing M60 tanks with a weapon capable of firing both conventional HEAT rounds and launching ATGMs. The result were the M551 and M60A2 tanks.
