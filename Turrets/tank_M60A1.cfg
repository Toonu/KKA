	description = The M60 is an American second generation main battle tank. It was officially standardized in March 1959. Although developed from the M48 Patton, the M60 tank series was never officially classified but sometimes informally grouped, as a member of the Patton tank family. The M60 tank series became America's primary main battle tank during the Cold War. Hull production ended in 1983.
