	description = The OKB-9 Object 137Sh / T-54-3 main battle tank turret armed with 52-PT-412 / D-10T 100mm rifled gun introduced in the years following the Second World War. The first T-54 prototype was completed by the end of 1945. The T-54 eventually became the main tank for armoured units of the Soviet Army, armies of the Warsaw Pact countries, and many others. T-54s and T-55s have been involved in many of the world's armed conflicts since the later part of the 20th century.
