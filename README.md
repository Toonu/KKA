# KKA
Kerbal Kombat Anthology Mod

# GameData

 ## Manual install:
 
 - Download one of the releases and put it into your KSP/GameData
 
 
 ## How to install:
 
- Install git to your computer (preferably GUI version, for example the https://desktop.github.com/ )
-  Clone the repository by clicking clone & download button and copying the URL.
- Launch the installed program and close new repository, insert the URL and clone the repository to any directory in your computer.
- When the download is finished, you are done. Feel free to copy the files from this folder to your KSP/GameData

 ## Additional Steps to improve the automation:
 
- If you move all files, including hidden .git folder from the cloned folder to the KSP/GameData and delete the cloned folder and restart the program, it will get confused and tell you the cloned repository is missing. When it asks, point it at the new location of the repository in your GameData folder.
- This way the git manages your GameData directory and you won't have to move the files between the cloned folder and your GameData.

 ## How to update the mod to latest iteration:
 
- When the mod gets updated, you get notification in the discord server that new release has been released.
- After that, you launch the git program once again and fetch/pull origin to download the latest changes.
- If it will pop up error, r-click on your changes in the left panel (in GitHub desktop specifically) and click discard all changes. After that, retry pulling from origin and it will work.
 
 ## How to report an issue:
 
- To report an issue, go to the https://github.com/Toonu/KSP-NoU-Modpack/issues and report issue.
- Try to be maximally descriptive and describe what happened, when and most importantly how, or what different behaviour you expected to happen.
- Please do not make issues that are already there.
- Bring videos or pictures if needed!

## How to contribute to the development:

- If you're familiar with git (or even when you are not), you can make your own changes to the modpack in your GameData and then do a pull-request (Menu Branch > Create a pull request) to the main repository which will go through testing and application process.
