 ## How to report an issue:
 
- To report an issue, go to the https://github.com/Toonu/KSP-NoU-Modpack/issues and report issue.
- Try to be maximally descriptive and describe what happened, when and most importantly how, or what different behaviour you expected to happen.
- Please do not make issues that are already there.
- Bring videos or pictures if needed!

 ## How to contribute to the development:

- If you're familiar with git (or even when you are not), you can make your own changes to the modpack in your GameData and then do a pull-request (Menu Branch > Create a pull request) to the main repository which will go through testing and application process.
